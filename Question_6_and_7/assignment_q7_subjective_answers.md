#### $Q.$ What do You infer from Top 10 features of ***Random Forest*** and Top 10 weights of ***Linear Regression***?

#### $Ans.$ <p align="justify"> The Top <b><i>10 features</b></i> in <b><i>Random forest</i></b> are not the same as the Top <b><i>10 weights</b></i> of the <b><i>Linear Regression</b></i> model. The difference in the features and weights in these models can be the result of the difference in the working of these models. The Random Forest model is an ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. The Linear Regression model, on the other hand, uses a linear equation to make predictions. The random forest model is a non-linear model, and the linear regression model is a linear model. The prior makes fewer assumptions about the linear relation of the attributes of the data while the later assumes a linear relation between the attributes of the data. <br><b><i>Hence, due to these difference in the working of these models, the top 10 features of the Random Forest model and the top 10 weights of the Linear Regression model are different.</b></i></p>
