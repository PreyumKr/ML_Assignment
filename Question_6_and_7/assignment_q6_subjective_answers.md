#### $Q.$ Is the usage of ***Linear Regression Model*** for ***classification*** justified? Why or Why not?

#### $Ans.$ <p align="justify"> <b><i>No, the usage of Linear regression is not justified for classification tasks</b></i>. As we can see in the above example, first of all the linear regression model predicts values for newer data in a bigger range that can go above and below the range of the target variables on which it was trained which is not expected from a well trained classification model and even after we clip the results of the linear regression model between the desired range, the predicted values that lie between the target values are not discrete. When we rounded the predicted values to the nearest integer, the accuracy of the linear regression model droped below that of the decision tree and random forest models.<br> <b><i>Hence, the usage of Linear Regression Model for classification is not justified.</b></i></p>
